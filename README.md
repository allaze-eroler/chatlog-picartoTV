# chatlog-picartoTV
A chatlog layout for picarto.

All you need to do is follow this tutorial and then, copy and paste the code source I made for the chatlog: https://help.picarto.tv/help/chat-overlay-in-obs-studio-268424c9

Before you save the file, it's best for you to change a few thing in the root section, most of time it's just colors. Here the file where you can get: https://github.com/allaze-eroler/chatlog-picartoTV/blob/main/picartoTV-chatlog.css

here what you will get when you use it:
